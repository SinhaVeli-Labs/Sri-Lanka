        <h1>THE BEAUTY OF SRI LANKA</h1>

            <p>
                Sri Lanka (ශ්‍රී ලංකා) is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean,
                just off the southeastern coast of India. Despite its modest size—slightly larger than
                the state of West Virginia—Sri Lanka has a population of about 20 million people, almost
                equal to the population of Texas. The island is rich in natural resources, and has a
                diverse economy based on agriculture, mining, fishing, manufacturing, and tourism.
                On becoming an independent nation in 1948 Sri Lanka (formerly called Ceylon) seemed to
                be headed for a future as a stable and prosperous democracy. Since the 1970s, however,
                the country has been torn by violent struggles between the two main ethnic groups,
                Sinhalese and Tamils, that make up its population. Sri Lanka suffered severe damage and
                loss of life from the tsunami of 2004; what effect that disaster will have on the
                country’s political future remains to be seen.
